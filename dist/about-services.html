                            <div class="row">
                                <div class="col-lg-6">
                                    <p>School was wonderful in the beginning. I loved elementary school—every moment of those six years. But everything changed when I transitioned to 7th grade. Middle school marked the beginning of a very difficult chapter in my educational journey.</p>

                                    <p>I wasn't a bad student because I lacked intelligence; I was simply bored. School became a place of routine, pressure, and little joy. It lost its spark. I began skipping as much as possible, hiding in the small space between my bed and the wall to avoid going. I missed an average of 35 days a year but managed to pass my tests, thanks to a sharp mind and the absence of strict attendance policies in the '80s. My family assumed I just wasn't academic—or, as they kindly put it, I was "the creative type."</p>

                                    <p>After a short-lived attempt at traditional college, I found a small art school and graduated in 1991. While I succeeded academically, the environment still didn't resonate with me. School, no matter the type, felt stifling. But everything changed in 1994 when I had the chance to study abroad in England. That experience changed my life. The educational model was more relaxed, project-based, and full of freedom. I was older than most students—23 to their 19—but I finally felt like I belonged.</p>

                                    <p>One of those temporary jobs became a turning point. I interviewed to be an administrative assistant at a large charter school in Cincinnati. The principal saw my background in art and design and asked me to teach art instead. Despite my history with school, I said yes.</p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="col-lg-6">
                                    <p>My first year, in 2001, was rough. I taught as I had been taught, and my students—mostly inner-city youth—didn't connect with me. Then I changed my approach. I taught them what I knew: how to transform things creatively. Jeans into skirts. Sewing. Fashion. Tiling. Candle-making. Art they could relate to. I became a hit in the classroom. But what broke my heart was that so many of my students couldn't read or write—at all. Many high schoolers were functioning four to five years below grade level. That became my mission.</p>

                                    <p>I continued working in charter schools as both an art teacher and an Intervention Specialist (IS). My connection with students helped me teach them how to succeed using accommodations and modifications, appropriate reading levels, and abridged texts. I eventually left teaching to take a corporate job while earning my Bachelor's degree. After four difficult years in the corporate world, I pursued a Master's in Multicultural Education and Interventions, followed closely by the start of a PhD program. I have completed all but the dissertation.</p>

                                    <p>When something is truly interesting—when it becomes a passion—drive and grit take over. I contracted as an IS across the city, learning curriculum programs, writing IEPs and ETRs, and eventually training others to run successful special education programs. Over the past 12+ years, I have helped hundreds of students learn to read, write, and perform math with fluency. I've also taught social-emotional skills and self-regulation strategies to help students manage stress and anxiety.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Now, my next journey begins.</strong> I've applied to be a Jon Peterson provider in the State of Ohio, allowing me to work with homeschooled students or those who require instruction outside the traditional classroom. My ultimate dream is to open a micro school for students like myself—children who don't thrive in traditional educational environments.</p>

                            <p class="text-center">Throughout my life and career, my faith has been my steady compass, guiding every decision and leading me to the places I've been. Each position I've held, every step I've taken, has been a divine stepping stone, part of God's greater plan for me. Though at times the path wasn't always clear, I've trusted that the Lord's hand was in every decision, every challenge, and every success.</p>

                            <p class="text-center">From my studies in Biblical Studies and Management to my work in the professional world, my faith has provided me with the strength, wisdom, and courage to move forward, even when faced with uncertainty. I believe that every opportunity has been a chance to grow, not just in knowledge and skill, but in character and faith.</p>

                            <p class="text-center">Now, as I embark on this new journey, I know that it is not by my own strength but by God's grace and guidance that I am here. Each chapter of my story has brought me to this moment, where I can use what I've learned and the gifts I've been given to serve others. This new path is another chapter in a journey of purpose, a journey that I walk with the Lord by my side.</p>
