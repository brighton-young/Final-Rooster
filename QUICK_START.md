## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Icons not showing?**
Bootstrap Icons are imported via SCSS. If icons don't show:
1. Make sure build completed successfully
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify Bootstrap Icons font files are in `dist/assets/`

### **Images not lazy loading?**
1. Check services.html has `loading="lazy"` on all gallery images
2. Test in a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
3. Scroll slowly to see effect

### **Build errors?**
The Sass deprecation warnings are normal and won't affect functionality. They're just notifications about future Sass versions.
